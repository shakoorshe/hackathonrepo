<body>
    <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in
        the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The
        Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. The
        Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 17 NBA championships, tied
        with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history.</p>
    <p>The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball
        League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves the Minneapolis
        Lakers.[11] Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival
        Basketball Association of America, where they would win five of the next six championships, led by star George
        Mikan.[12] After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los
        Angeles before the 1960â€“61 season.</p>
