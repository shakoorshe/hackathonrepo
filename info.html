    <h2 id="laker-info"> Information about the Lakers</h2>
    <p class="p-text">The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The
        Lakers compete in
        the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Western Conference Pacific Division. The
        Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena shared with the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. The
        Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA, and have won 17 NBA championships, tied
        with the Boston Celtics for the most in NBA history.</p>
    <p class="p-text">The franchise began with the 1947 purchase of a disbanded team, the Detroit Gems of the National
        Basketball
        League (NBL). The new team began playing in Minneapolis, Minnesota, calling themselves the Minneapolis
        Lakers. Initially a member of the NBL, the Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival
        Basketball Association of America, where they would win five of the next six championships, led by star George
        Mikan. After struggling financially in the late 1950s following Mikan's retirement, they relocated to Los
        Angeles before the 1960-61 season.</p>

        <h2 id="laker-pres">Most Influential Lakers Owners</h2>
        <h3 class="font-for-h3">Bob Short</h3>
        <p class="p-text">Bob Short acquired the Minneapolis Lakers in 1957 and eventually moved their team to the more affordable Los Angeles.  Although the owner of the team, Short acted as general manager and was responsible for bringing basketball great, Elgin Baylor to the roster.
Short was also influential in working with Mohs in bringing possibly the most iconic basketball figure to the NBA: its logo, Jerry West. When the Lakers drafted West, Short helped reunite him with his former head coach Fred Schaus from West Virginia.
            
            The two would become some of the most influential Lakers figures of all time.  As an owner, Short had a vision upon moving to Los Angeles, while some of his methods may have seemed unorthodox at the time.
            
            
            Short ushered in the new age of the Lakers as his team consistently went to the playoffs and finals, although the road to a ring took a little longer than expected.
            
            Without Short, though, the Lakers most likely would have never moved to L.A. and enjoyed the success of the following decades of dominance in the NBA.
